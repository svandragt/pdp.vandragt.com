Let's review the existing PDP entries:

## Software design paradigms
 
  * **Actions**: Learn about pros/cons of established software paradigms such as Convention over configuration.
  * **Support**: Books [The Architecture of Open Source Applications ](http://www.aosabook.org/), [Design Patterns by the Gang of Four](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18753299-design-patterns---elements-of-reusable-object-oriented-software)
  * **Impact**: Better structure ‘from scratch’ projects / improve legacy code.
  * **Measures**: 
  	- Apply in side project Cuttlefish blog or unmaintained HM plugin/repo.
  	- Blog around when to choose paradigms.
  * **Timeline**: Review End of July 2020.

 Well clearly that never happened, thanks pandemic! It would still be good to work through those books and action it so I will revise the timeline to February 2021. Timeline deferred.


## React Training
 
  * **Actions**: Finish “Intermedia React” on FrontEnd Masters
  * **Impact**: Able to lead and participate in projects with significant frontend work
  * **Measures**: Successful onboarding on Siemens Ingenuity
  * **Timeline**: End of June 2021

This happened but I did not meet the impact assessment, however I've onboarded to the project and build smaller features. Completed.
