Welcome. This is an experiment to document my Personal Development Plan in the open.

It replaces a Google Doc which has the following problems:

 * Completed objectives are deleted, effectively lost.
 * Changes are not easily reviewed in a timeline.
 * It's not easily shared with others for feedback. 
 
Not sure if having this is the open is a good idea but it's at least worth an experiment. Plus I wanted to use Hugo.
