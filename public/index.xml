      <description>Welcome. This is an experiment to document my Personal Development Plan in the open.
It replaces a Google Doc which has the following problems:
 Completed objectives are deleted, effectively lost. Changes are not easily reviewed in a timeline. It&amp;rsquo;s not easily shared with others for feedback.  Not sure if having this is the open is a good idea but it&amp;rsquo;s at least worth an experiment. Plus I wanted to use Hugo.</description>
